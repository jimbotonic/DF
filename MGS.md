# MGS File Format

MGS stands for Massive Graph Storage. It is a binary file format to store the toplogy of massive directed graphs in a compact form. 

In the following sections, we describe the MGS file format in detail. $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph.


## MGS version 3

MGS version 3 stores graphs in the form of adjacency lists in a single file {graph-name}.mgs.

The graph vertices are encoded as unsigned integers over a variable size of bytes determined by the number $n$ of vertices to be represented (see below). 

The file header is 12 bytes long. It is composed of the following fields:

* File format identifier: 'MGS' string (3 bytes)
* Version number: major 0x03 + minor 0x00 (2 bytes)
* Flags (2 bytes)
  * Graph type  (4 bits) + compression scheme (4 bits)
  * Coding scheme (4 bits) + reserved flags (4 bits)
* Number of vertices (5 bytes)

The possible graph types are:
* 0x0: directed graph
* 0x1: undirected graph

The possible compression algorithms are:
* 0x0: no compression
* 0x1: Huffman encoding of vertex ids

The possible coding schemes are:
* 0x0: data section only with implicit numbering of vertices
* 0x1: index section + data section with explicit numbering of vertices

The number of bytes allocated for each vertex id is computed as follows:

$$ size\_t = \lceil log_2 (n+1) \rceil$$

### 0x0 Coding Scheme (data section only)

There is no index section. The data section contains contiguous lists of vertex ids representing the children of each vertex numbered implicitly from $1$ to $n. Each adjacency list is terminated by a special value $0$ of $size\_t$ bytes, except for the last one. 

NB: by reordering the vertices by decreasing out-degree allows, it is possible to spare adding $0$-termination values corresponding to $0$-out-degree vertices. 

### 0x1 Coding Scheme (index + data sections)

The index section starts directly after the header and has a size of $size\_t * n$ bytes. Each entry indicates the number of children of the corresponding vertex numbered implicitly from $1$ to $n$.

The following data section contains contiguous lists of vertex ids representing the children of each vertex.


## Deprecated MGS formats

### MGS version 1 (deprecated)

MGS version 1 stores graphs in the form of adjacency lists in two separate files: 
* The graph index is a set of contiguous (vertex id, start of adjacency list position) pairs.
* The graph data is a set of contiguous vertex ids representing the children of each vertex specified in the index.

NB:
* Vertex ids do not need to be contiguous. 
* Vertex ids and adjacency list positions are stored in big endian format at both bit and byte levels.
* Vertex ids and adjacency list positions are stored as unsigned integers of the specified size `size_t`.
* Adjacency list positions are 1-based.

The two MGS files have the same name with the following extensions: {graph-name}.index and {graph-name}.data.

* The graph index is a set of contiguous start of adjacency list positions.
* The graph data is a set of contiguous vertex ids representing the children of each vertex specified in the index.

* Adjacency list positions are stored in big endian format at both bit and byte levels.

* In case a vertex has no child, $pos[k] = pos[k+1]$ in the index file. 

The two MGS files have the same name with the following extensions: {graph-name}.index and {graph-name}.data.
